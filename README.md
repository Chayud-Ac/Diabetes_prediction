# Diabete prediction

" This project aim to predict class between diabete and non-diabete using machine learning algorithms random forest. The purpose is to study the process of data cleansing , data preparation , model preparation and training , and model evaluation. Since machine learning require manually feature extraction unlike neural network that does not require manual feature extraction. This project demostrate how we do necessary task for developing machine learning model"

# setup

### 2. Create and activate conda environment using environment.yml (This provided all library using in this project)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate diabetes  # Double check the name in environment.yml

```
